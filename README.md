# ANN-CNN-Implementation-Repository

## Overview
This repository contains practical implementations of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. These projects leverage deep learning techniques for predictive analytics and image classification.

## Projects Included

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn based on historical customer behavior data. The model helps identify customers at risk of leaving a service.

#### **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes data.
- **Neural Network Model:** Built using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple hidden layers.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for performance analysis.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras.
- **Data Handling:** pandas, NumPy.
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn.

#### **Usage**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Customer_Churn_using_ANN.ipynb` to train and evaluate the ANN model.

### 2. Image Classification using CNN
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification tasks, demonstrating the power of deep learning in computer vision.

#### **Features**
- **Dataset Handling:** Uses an image dataset for training and testing.
- **CNN Architecture:** Multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract image features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, loss plots, and confusion matrix.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras.
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV, PIL.
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn.

#### **Usage**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `cnn.ipynb` to train and test the CNN model.
